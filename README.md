# deep-learning-partial-programs

This tool learns code embeddings from partial programs using the graph representation framewok structure2vec. Learned code embeddings can be used for efficient similarity search and code classification. Please refer to my project (https://github.com/fischerfel/APDG) to generate feature vectors from source code that can be used with this tool.

## Research Paper
Both tools are part of our USENIX Security 2019 research paper "Stack Overflow Considered Helpful! Deep Learning Security Nudges Towards Stronger Cryptography" (https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/fischer)
